    Developing a Resilient & Scalable REST API with Hexagonal Architecture & DDD

:warning: This solution intentionally remains incomplete, serving solely as a demonstration of constructing a resilient infrastructure.

Greetings and welcome to our public GitHub repository. 

Here, we embark on a meticulous endeavor to construct a robust REST API, meticulously adhering to the tenets of Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) from inception.
Within this project, we employ the latest advancements, notably .NET 6 and EF Core, to architect our solution with precision. 
We adhere to industry-standard methodologies, incorporating foundational patterns such as :
- CQRS
- Unit of work
- Repository
- Mediator

The main goal here is to ensure a codebase that is both scalable and maintainable.

In addition to our architectural choices, we integrate select open-source libraries such as : 
- MediatR
- FluentValidation
- ErrorOr
- Throw
- Mapster and others.

These augment our development experience, elevating our application's capabilities to meet contemporary standards.

Our development environment centers on Rider JetBrains and the dotnet CLI.
Leveraging a suite of meticulously chosen Rider plugins, we streamline our workflow, facilitating tasks ranging from crafting HTTP requests to database interaction, debugging, and token analysis.

Classical TDD : This solution was built in a continuous cycle of coding and refactoring, systematically addressing a spectrum of conceptual nuances.
